## ðŸ“˜ Project 1: Salary Dashboard

**Objective**
Create an interactive dashboard to explore salary data for data-related jobs across job titles, countries, and work schedules.

**Key Excel Skills**

* Charts (Bar chart, Map chart)
* Array formulas (`MEDIAN`, `IF`, `FILTER`)
* Data validation (dropdown filters)

**Dataset**

* 2023 dataset of job titles, salaries, countries, and job types.

**Dashboard Features**

1. **Median Salary by Job Title** â€“ Bar chart sorted descending for clarity.
2. **Country Median Salaries** â€“ Excel Map chart visualising salary levels by geography.
3. **Job Schedule Type** â€“ Filterable list of schedule types using `FILTER()`.
4. **User Filters** â€“ Dropdown lists for job title, country, and type to interact with the data.

**Insights**

* Senior/engineering roles consistently show higher pay than analyst roles.
* Salary levels vary significantly by country.
* Clean validation improves dashboard usability.

## ðŸ“˜ Project 2: Job Skills & Salary Analysis

**Objective**
Analyse the impact of technical skills on salaries and identify top-paying skills in the data job market.

**Key Excel Skills**

* Power Query (Extract, Transform, Load)
* Power Pivot (Data models & relationships)
* DAX formulas (custom measures)
* PivotTables & PivotCharts (salary + skill analysis)

**Dataset**

* `data_salary_all.xlsx` containing:

  * `data_jobs_all` (job details & salaries)
  * `data_job_skills` (skills by job ID)

**Analytical Questions**

1. Do more skills = better pay?
2. What are salaries across regions (US vs Non-US)?
3. What are the top skills of data professionals?
4. Whatâ€™s the pay for the top 10 skills?

**Findings**

* More skills are linked to higher salaries (esp. for Data Scientists/Engineers).
* US salaries remain higher than non-US equivalents, particularly in tech roles.
* SQL, Python, AWS, and Azure dominate as top skills.
* Python, Oracle, and SQL are tied to the highest-paying jobs.
